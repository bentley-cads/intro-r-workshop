## Set-up the environment and data

Load the `tidyverse` library to work with the data.
`library()`

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the Palmer Penguins data set and assign it to a
variable.
`library()` and `<-`

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
dta <- penguins
```

## What are we working with?

How many observations and how many features (variables)
do we have in the data set?
`dim()` or `nrow()` and `ncol()`

```{r}
dim(dta)
```

What are the names of the variables in the data set?
`names()`

```{r}
names(dta)
```

Are all the variables in the data set numeric or character?
The function `str()` will give you the **structure** of the
data set and a few observations for each variable.

```{r}
str(dta)
```

Print out the first few rows of the data set.
`head()`

```{r}
head(dta)
```

Print the last 15 rows of the data set.
`tail()`

```{r}
tail(dta, n = 15)
```

## What kinds of penguins do we have?

How many different species of penguins do we have?
`unique()` and `$`

```{r}
unique(dta$species)
```

How many observations do we have of each type of penguin?
`table()` or `xtabs()`

```{r}
table(dta$species)
```

Another way of computing this is:

```{r}
xtabs( ~ species, data = dta)
```

I have heard that some penguins do not like some
of the islands, but other penguins like all of the
islands.  Is that true?

Create a table where the rows are the penguin species
and the columns are the islands.  The entries in the
table should be the number of penguins.

```{r}
(tbl <- table(dta$species, dta$island))
```

Do the sum of all your table entries match the total
number of observations in your data set?

```{r}
sum(tbl)
```

```{r}
(xtbl <- xtabs( ~ species + island, data = dta))
```

```{r}
sum(xtbl)
```

Are there any missing values in the body mass variable?
`any()`, `is.na()`

```{r}
any(is.na(dta$body_mass_g))
```

Which observations are those?
`which()`

```{r}
(idx <- which(is.na(dta$body_mass_g)))
```

Display those records with missing body mass.
`[]`

```{r}
dta[idx,]
```

Remove the rows of data with a missing weight and 
store the data in a new variable.

```{r}
dtb <- dta[-idx,]
```

## Let's look at penguin weight

Which penguins weigh between 6,000 and 6,500 grams?
Create an index variable, called `idx`, that is true
if the weight is in this range and false otherwise.
How many penguins fall in this weight range?

```{r}
idx <- dtb$body_mass_g >= 6000 & dtb$body_mass_g <= 6500
sum(idx)
```

Display the penguins in this range.

```{r}
dtb[idx,]
```

What is the average weight (in kilograms) across all
the penguins for which we have their weight?
`mean()`

```{r}
mean(dtb$body_mass_g)/1000
```

I have heard that all three types of penguins are
about the same size.  Is it true that average weight
for all three penguins is the same?
`group_by()`, `summarize()`, `%>%`

```{r}
dtb %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avg.weight = mean(body_mass_g))
```

What is the one standard deviation interval around 
the mean weight for these penguins?
`group_by()`, `summarize()`, `mean()`, and `sd()`

```{r}
wt <- dtb %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avg.weight = mean(body_mass_g),
            std.dev = sd(body_mass_g))
wt
```

```{r}
wt$lo.weight <- wt$avg.weight - wt$std.dev
wt$hi.weight <- wt$avg.weight + wt$std.dev
wt
```

## Body Mass Index for penguins?

Humans use the body mass index (BMI) to determine if
someone is under-weight, normal weight, or over-weight.
Let's invent a penguin body mass index.
Maybe we can call it PMI for penguin mass index.

Humans use the formula
$$
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight}}{\text{Height}^2}
$$
where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.

Let's try the following formula for the penguins
$$
  \text{PMI} = \frac{\text{Weight}}{(2.3 \times\text{Flipper})^2}
$$
where weight is in grams and flipper is the flipper length
in centimeters. (There are 10 millimeters in each centimeter.)

## Penguin Mass Index

Add a new variable to the data set, say `pmi`, that
computes the penguin mass index as given by the above
formula.
`<-`, `$`, `/`, `*`, `^`

```{r}
dtb$pmi <- dtb$body_mass_g / (2.3 * dtb$flipper_length_mm/10)^2
```

Give a summary of the penguin mass index.
`summary()`

```{r}
summary(dtb$pmi)
```

Plot a histogram of the penguin mass index.
`ggplot()`, `geom_histogram()`, `labs()`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = dtb,
            mapping = aes(x = pmi))
p <- p + geom_histogram()
p <- p + labs(x = "Penguin Mass Index")
p
```

## Penguin Bills (not the utility kind)

Is the bill length and depth related to each other?

Create a scatterplot with bill length on the $x$-axis
and bill depth on the $y$-axis.
`ggplot()`, `geom_point()`, `labs()`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = dtb,
            mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                          y = bill_depth_mm))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + labs(x = "Bill Length (in mm)",
              y = "Bill Depth (in mm)")
p
```

What kind of patterns do you see in the scatterplot?

Can you color the points differently by the penguin's
species?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = dtb,
            mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                          y = bill_depth_mm,
                          color = species))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + labs(x = "Bill Length (in mm)",
              y = "Bill Depth (in mm)")
p
```

Maybe we should remove the rows where we have 
missing information. Find out, for each variable
in the data set, which rows have missing information.
`lapply()`, `function()`

```{r}
(miss <- lapply(dta, function(x) which(is.na(x))))
```

Since rows 4, and 272 are missing the penguin
measurements, we'll remove them.
Create a subset without these two rows.
`c()`, `-`

```{r}
dtb <- dta[-c(4, 272),]
```

From the above plot, it looks like as bill length 
increases, so does bill depth.  Fit a linear
model for each species separately.

## Linear regressions

Are the slopes of the lines comparable across species?
`lm()`, `summary()`

```{r}
lm.a <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm,
           data = dtb,
           subset = species == "Adelie")
summary(lm.a)
```

```{r}
lm.c <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm,
           data = dtb,
           subset = species == "Chinstrap")
summary(lm.c)
```

```{r}
lm.g <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm,
           data = dtb,
           subset = species == "Gentoo")
summary(lm.g)
```

Create a plot of bill length by bill depth, colored 
by species, and superimpose the linear fits.
`ggplot()`, `geom_point()`, `geom_smooth()`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = dtb,
            mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                          y = bill_depth_mm,
                          color = species))
p <- p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm",
                                    se = FALSE)
p <- p + labs(x = "Bill Length (in mm)",
              y = "Bill Depth (in mm)")
p
```

Looking at the estimated slopes for the lines and
their standard errors, do you think that all three
models have essentially the same slope?

We can compute confidence intervals with the
function `confint()`.

```{r}
rbind("Adelie" = confint(lm.a)[2,],
      "Gentoo" = confint(lm.g)[2,],
      "Chinstrap" = confint(lm.c)[2,])
```


## More involved questions

Human females tend (on average) to be smaller than
males.  Does the same thing happen for penguins in
each species?

Since we have lots of rows with missing sex information,
let's remove them from the data set.
`na.omit()`

```{r}
dtc <- na.omit(dtb)
```

Compute average weight, flipper, bill length and depth, 
by species and sex.
`group_by()`, `summarize()`, `mean()`

```{r}
dtc %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarise(avg.weight = mean(body_mass_g),
            avg.flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            avg.bill.len = mean(bill_length_mm),
            avg.bill.dep = mean(bill_depth_mm))
```

Are the differences significant? Compute standard
deviations and use them to see if there are big
differences?
`group_by()`, `summarize()`, `sd()`

```{r}
dtc %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarise(std.weight = sd(body_mass_g),
            std.flipper = sd(flipper_length_mm),
            std.bill.len = sd(bill_length_mm),
            std.bill.dep = sd(bill_depth_mm))
```
